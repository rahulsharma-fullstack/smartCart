## AI-Driven Personalized Recommendation and In-Store Navigation System

Tired of frustrated shoppers wandering lost in your aisles? SmartCart is the AI-powered solution that personalizes the shopping experience and helps customers find what they need faster with easy-to-use in-store navigation. In present, retail businesses are increasingly pressured to boost sales, improve customer experience and organize their operations to remain competitive. SmartCart targets to address both of these areas by engaging artificial intelligence(AI) and machine learning technologies to provide customer personalized product recommendations while at the same time guiding them through the store using in-store navigation tools. SmartCart is useful for retail stores with a large inventory of items for example grocery stores, department stores, and large retail chains, where customers often find themselves confused by the wide range of products available. By initiating this technology, retail businesses can offer a specialized shopping experience for customers, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty, while also collecting important valuable data on consumer behaviour and priorities.
